Installation
=============

Requirements
------------
Our projects

- hadoopy_ (`doc <http://hadoopy.co>`_): Cython based Hadoop library for Python.  Efficient, simple, and powerful.
- picarus_takeout_: C/C++ module that contains the core picarus algorithms, separate so that it can be built as a standalone executable.

Third party

- Scipy_
- OpenCV_
- Hadoop_ (CDH_ recommended)

Useful Tools
---------------------------
These are all optional, but you may find them useful.  Our projects (ordered by relevance)

- hadoopy_flow_: Hadoopy monkey patch library to perform automatic job-level parallelism.
- vision_data_: Library of computer vision dataset interfaces with standardized output formats.
