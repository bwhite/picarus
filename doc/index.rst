About
--------

Picarus is a Computer Vision and Machine Learning web service and library for large-scale visual analysis.  Behind the scenes it uses Hadoop/HBase and the front end provides an easy to use REST interface and web app.  This is a broad project and is under active development, `contact us <http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01GfY5qDZPQDqNv_cVZ-Ggtw==&c=teonLxZzQ3hgUE23_LhQj2uql4r6SF7G1JBprXcfJ0M=>`_ if you are interested in using it or would like to take part in the development.
