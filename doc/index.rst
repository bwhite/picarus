About
--------

Picarus is a Computer Vision web service and library for large-scale visual analysis.  Behind the scenes it uses Hadoop/HBase and the front end provides an easy to use REST interface and web app.  This is a broad project and is under active development, contact us if you are interested in using it or would like to take part in the development.  Visit https://github.com/bwhite/picarus/ for the source.

Who
---
Picarus is developed by `Dapper Vision, Inc. <http://dappervision.com>`_ (`Brandyn White <http://brandynwhite.com>`_ and `Andrew Miller <http://blog.soc1024.com/pages/about-andrew-miller>`_).  We are PhD students at UMD and UCF respectively and are interested in Computer Vision, Web-Scale Machine Learning, HCI, Cryptography, and Social Networks.

::

        Picarus Web App           HBase scales big              Free Software for all
        Visual Analysis   Scan slices with high throughput   Large Scale Computer Vision
       Look in your data           Contiguous Rows                 As Apache Two  


::

       Hadoop's not easy                                        Privacy is key
   Abstraction lowers the bar                          What we don't know can't hurt you
      REST is for humans                                       Ignorance is safe
