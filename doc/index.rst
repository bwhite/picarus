Picarus is a Computer Vision web service and library for large-scale visual analysis.  Behind the scenes it uses Hadoop/HBase and the front end provides an easy to use REST interface and web app.  This is a broad project and is under active development, contact us if you are interested in using it or would like to take part in the development.
