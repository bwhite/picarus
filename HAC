HAC
- Perform K-means first to reduce the number of initial clusters to a practical size (a function of our computational resources)
- Compute the N^2 distance matrix as distance vectors (each point has a vector).
-- Input: All points with cluster assignments in the form of (cluster_num, point_list)
-- Output: (cluster_num, list_of_dists_to_each_cluster) and all points with cluster assignments
- Find the nearest clusters (min of all distance vectors), these are to be merged
-- Input: (cluster_num, list_of_dists_to_each_cluster)
-- Output: (cluster_0, cluster_1) with the merged cluster as cluster_0
- Merge and compact the clusters, find the new distances (Order Inversion), go to the previous step until done
-- Config Input: (cluster_0, cluster_1)
-- Input: All points with cluster assignments and (cluster_num, list_of_dists_to_each_cluster)
-- Output: (cluster_num, list_of_dists_to_each_cluster) and all points with cluster assignments
