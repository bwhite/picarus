Compute features from face images

Eigenfaces:
-----------
Training:
-- Input:  - images - N grayscale images of the same size
           - vectors - a list of eigenvector indexes to use for the face feature (0 has the largest eigenvalue)
-- Output: - V - a set of projection vectors corresponding to 'vectors'
           - m - the mean vector of the training images

Testing:
-- Input:  - image - rgb image of the same size as the training images
-- Output: - feature - a len(vectors) dimensional vector
